A Company wants to automate its payroll process. You have been assigned 
as the programmer to build this package. You would like to showcase your 
skills by creating a quick prototype. The prototype consists of the 
following steps:
1.Read Employee details from the User. The details would include id, 
designation and salary in the given order. The datatype for id is integer
, designation is string and salary is integer.
2.You decide to build two hashmaps. The first hashmap contains 
employee id as key and designation as value, and the second hashmap 
contains same employee ids as key and salary as value.
3.The company decides to hike the salary of managers by 5000. 
You decide to write a function increaseSalaries which takes the above 
hashmaps as input and returns a hashmap with only managers id and their 
increased salary as output. Include this function in class UserMainCode.

 
Create a Class Main which would be used to read employee details in 
step 1 and build the two hashmaps. Call the static method present in 
UserMainCode.

Input and Output Format:
Input consists of employee details. The first number indicates the size 
of the employees. The next three values indicate the employee id, 
employee designation and employee salary.

Output consists of a single string.

Refer sample output for formatting specifications.
