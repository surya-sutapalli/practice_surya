Given an int array and a number as input, 
write a program to add all the elements in the array greater than 
the given number. Finally reverse the digits of the obtained sum 
and print it.
 
Include a class UserMainCode with a static method “addAndReverse” 
that accepts 2 arguments and returns an integer.The first argument 
corresponds to the integer array and the second argument corresponds 
to the number.
 
Create a class Main which would get the required input and call the 
static method addAndReverse present in the UserMainCode.
 
Example:
Input Array = {10,15,20,25,30,100}
Number = 15
sum = 20 + 25 + 30 + 100 = 175
output = 571
 
Input and Output Format:
The first line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to the number of elements in the array.
The next n lines of the input consists of integers that correspond to the elements in the array.
The last line of the input consists of an integer that corresponds to the number.
 
Output consists of a single integer.
