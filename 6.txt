Write a program to check if the first word and the last word in 
the input string match. 

Include a class UserMainCode with a static method “check” that accepts 
a string argument and returns an int. If the first word and the last word 
in the string match, the method returns the number of characters in the
word. Else the method returns the sum of the number of characters in the 
first word and last word.

Create a class Main which would get the input as a String and call the static method check present in the UserMainCode.
Input and Output Format:
Input consists of a string.
Output is an integer.

Sample Input 1:

Sample Output 1:
3

Sample Input 2:
